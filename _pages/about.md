Hi! I'm a student, software engineer, researcher, dancer, musician, and foodie. I'm based in NYC.

My interests lie in the intersection of formal verification, programming languages, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and computing in healthcare.

I am currently working on two projects: Augmenting Clinical Decisions via Expert-Informed Transformers and PhysioLabXR Scripting Graphic Programming Interface Design and Code Generation with Prof. Steven Feiner, Prof. Kaveri Thakoor, and Prof. Paul Sajda.

Most of my previous work was done as a research assistant with Prof. Mark Santolucito in Barnard Programming Languages Lab. Learn more in my [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) and [projects page](/al-folio/projects/)!

This summer through the CMU's REUSE 2023 program, I had the incredible opportunity to work with Prof. Eunsuk Kang on the robustness of Electronic Health Records, doing research at the intersection of software engineer and human-computer interaction.

Please feel free to reach out to me at lc3542@columbia.edu ☀️
