        Hi! I‚Äôm a student, researcher, software engineer, dancer, and foodie. I‚Äôm based in NYC.
      </h3>
      <p>
        My interests lie in the intersection of formal verification, programming languages, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and computing in healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working on two projects: Augmenting Clinical Decisions via Expert-Informed Transformers and PhysioLabXR Scripting Graphic Programming Interface Design and Code Generation with Prof. Steven Feiner, Prof. Kaveri Thakoor, and Prof. Paul Sajda at Columbia University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my previous work was done as a research assistant with Prof. Mark Santolucito in Barnard Programming Languages Lab.

      <p>
        Last summer through the CMU‚Äôs REUSE 2023 program, I had the incredible opportunity to work with Prof. Eunsuk Kang on the robustness of Electronic Health Records, doing research at the intersection of formal methods and human-computer interaction.
