        Hi! I’m a student, researcher, software engineer, dancer, and foodie. I’m based in NYC.
      </h3>
      <h4>
        I am interested in programming language (PL) and software engineering (SE) research, with an angle of human-computer interaction (HCI).
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am currently working as a research assistant on Fuzzy Mental Model model checker with Prof. Eunsuk Kang and Prof. Matthew Bolton, and secure code generation with LLMs with Prof. Baishakhi Ray and Prof. Junfeng Yang.
