        Hi! I’m a student, researcher, software engineer, dancer, and foodie. I’m based in NYC.
      </h3>
      <h4>
        I am interested in programming language (PL) and software engineering (SE) research, with an angle of human-computer interaction (HCI).
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am currently working as a research assistant on ML-based runtime verification with Prof. Mark Santolucito and Prof. Baishakhi Ray, and Fuzzy Mental Model Finite State Machines model checker with Prof. Eunsuk Kang and Prof. Matthew Bolton.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my previous work was done as a research assistant with Prof. Mark Santolucito in Barnard Programming Languages Lab. Learn more in my <a class="link" target="_blank" href="publications.html">publications page</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="projects.html">projects page</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        Last summer through the CMU’s REUSE 2023 program, I had the incredible opportunity to work with Prof. Eunsuk Kang on the robustness of Electronic Health Records, doing research at the intersection of formal methods and human-computer interaction.
